# Attendance-Project
This project is to aid a friend that is running a club for campus.
Along with getting attendance for the club, reports are needed from the attendance.
The attendance is recorded through microsoft forms by QR code.
The data from the forms is placed in excel. The python program will read the excel spreadsheets and calculate the data to my friends needs and my friend's supervisor's needs.
